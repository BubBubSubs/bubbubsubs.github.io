Hi, I’m Bub Bub — at least that’s what my granddaughter used to call me when she was little, and the name just stuck. I’m a New York native who made my way down to the beautiful hills of Buena Vista, Virginia, bringing with me a big appetite and an even bigger love for good food.

I started Bub Bub Subs not just to serve sandwiches, but to serve comfort. The kind of hearty, satisfying subs that remind you of home — wherever that may be. With a dash of New York flavor and a whole lot of small-town heart, every sandwich is made the way I’d make it for my own family.
