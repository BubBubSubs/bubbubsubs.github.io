We’re not trying to reinvent the sandwich — just doing it the way it ought to be done. Fresh, local when we can, and always made with care.

Whether you're swinging by after a hike, grabbing lunch on your break, feeding a hungry crew, or in-between classes at SVU, we’ve got you covered. No gimmicks, no fluff — just subs that speak for themselves.

We’re not fast food, and we’re not fine dining. We’re just a small-town sub shop doing honest work, one sandwich at a time.

> The belly rules the mind. --- spanish proverb
